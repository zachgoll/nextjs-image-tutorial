# A complete guide to the Next.js Image Component

## Why??

- The Next.js Image component is **powerful**, yet often misused (and even potentially _dangerous_)
- I needed this tutorial myself

## Prerequisites

- Some experience with Next.js and React
- General understanding of web development

## What we will learn

1. What is Next.js Image and why is it so special?
2. Why should we care so much about images?
   a) "I'm not a designer, I really don't care about pretty images..."
   b) "An image is easy, just add a `src` property and be done with it!"
3. What does "Image optimization/transformation" mean?
4. A potentially **COSTLY ($$)** realization about image optimization
5. How to effectively use Next.js Image in different situations
   a) Using static images (local images)
   b) Using images with unknown sizes (remote images)
   c) Resizing images based on screen size (responsive images)
6. A brief migration guide from next/legacy/image to next/image
