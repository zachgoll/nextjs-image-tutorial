## Prerequisites

- Some experience with Next.js and React
- General understanding of web development

## What we will learn

1. What is Next.js Image and why is it special?
2. Why should we care so much about images?
   a) "I'm not a designer, I really don't care about pretty images..."
   b) "An image is easy, just add a `src` property and be done with it!"
3. What does "Image optimization/transformation" mean?
4. A potentially **COSTLY ($$)** realization about image optimization
5. How to effectively use Next.js Image in different situations
   a) Different layout modes (fill, fixed, responsive)
   b) Local vs. remote image usage
   c) Custom loaders (I'll write a custom loader for the Unsplash API)
6. A brief migration guide from next/legacy/image to next/image
